# Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors
#### •To visualize the dataset using scatter plots, histograms & bar plots and explore questions such as:
••Do students in more popular majors make more money?  
••How many majors are predominantly male or predominantly female?  
••What category of majors have the most students?

# Installation
•Clone this repo to your computer.  
•OPTIONAL: the original dataset can be found [here.](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors)  
•Install the requirements using pip3 install -r requirements.txt.  
•Make sure you use Python 3.  
•You may want to install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install) to run the ipynb.

# Usage
•Run the Jupyter Notebook "Earnings.Majors.ipynb" either in Jupyter or the IDE of your choice.

# Tasks Performed
### •Used scatter plots to examine relationships such as:
••Sample size and median.  
••Gender and median.  
••Sample size and unemployment rate.  
••Percentage women and unemployment rate.
### •Generated histograms to explore distributions of sample size, median, unemployment rate, gender, etc.
### •Continued further visualizations using scatter matrix plots and bar plots on the above-mentioned features.

# Observations
#### •Students in more popular majors do NOT make more money.
#### •From the plot Median vs Share Women (percentage women) students who majored in subjects that were majority female did NOT make more money. The plot Unemployment Rate vs Share Women also coroborates this showing that unemployment rates are higher in fields where there are more women.
#### •There is a positive correlation between the number of full-time employees and median salary. Fields with full-time employees have higher median salaries.
#### •From the ShareWomen (percentage women) histogram we can see that it is approximately 8% of majors are predominantly male and 8% predomninantly female.
#### •From the Median histogram the most common median salary is approximately $75,000.
