# Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors
#### •To visualize the dataset using scatter plots, histograms & bar plots and explore questions such as:
••Do students in more popular majors make more money?  
••How many majors are predominantly male or predominantly female?  
••What category of majors have the most students?

# Installation
•Clone this repo to your computer.  
•OPTIONAL: the original dataset can be found [here.](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors)  
•Install the requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt.  
•Make sure you use Python 3.  
•You may want to install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install) to run the ipynb.

# Usage
•Run the Jupyter Notebook "Earnings.Majors.ipynb" either in Jupyter or the IDE of your choice.

# Tasks Performed
### •Used scatter plots to examine relationships such as:
••Sample size and median.  
••Gender and median.  
••Sample size and unemployment rate.  
••Percentage women and unemployment rate.
### •Generated histograms to explore distributions of sample size, median, unemployment rate, gender, etc.
### •Continued further visualizations using scatter matrix plots and bar plots on the above-mentioned features.
